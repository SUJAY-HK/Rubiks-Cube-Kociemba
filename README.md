# üßÆ Kociemba's Algorithm - Complete Technical Documentation

## Overview

Kociemba's Algorithm is a computer algorithm for solving the 3√ó3√ó3 Rubik's Cube, created by Herbert Kociemba. It is similar to Thistlethwaite's algorithm but with fewer steps thanks to improvements in computer memory storage and processing speed.

## Two-Phase Approach

Let's ignore group theory and use the first two layers as an analogy.

### Core Concept

The core of the 2-phase approach is:
1. **Solve the cube into a state with a certain property**
2. **Solve the rest of the cube**

If we select F2L (First Two Layers) as our property, we get:
1. Solve the first two layers
2. Solve the last layer

If you solve F2L with the fewest moves possible, then solve the resulting LL case optimally, you'll end up with a decently short solution. However, there might be a shorter solution: in that case, the first phase might take more moves, but get us an easy LL case (or an LL skip!).

### Iterative Deepening (for Phase 1)

Let's say our first solution took 15 moves for F2L and 11 moves for LL. That means our cube takes at most 15 + 11 = 26 moves to solve.

So let's try looking at all the solutions that take 15 moves for F2L. If any of them give us an LL that takes fewer than 11 moves, we can find a shorter solution. Here's our systematic plan:

- Try all solutions that take 15 moves for F2L and fewer than 26 - 15 = 11 moves for LL
- Try all solutions that take 16 moves for F2L and fewer than 26 - 16 = 10 moves for LL
- Try all solutions that take 17 moves for F2L and fewer than 26 - 17 = 9 moves for LL
- ...and so on...
- Try all solutions that take 25 moves for F2L and fewer than 26 - 25 = 1 move for LL
- Try all solutions that take 26 moves for F2L and fewer than 26 - 26 = 0 moves for LL

If there is a solution that takes fewer than 26 moves for the entire cube, F2L clearly has to be finished in at most 26 moves. Therefore, our optimal overall solution has to be in one of these cases.

**Dynamic Upper Bound Adjustment:**
If along the way we find a solution that takes 17 moves for F2L and 8 moves for LL, we now know the entire cube can be solved in 17 + 8 = 25 moves. We abort the original 26-plan and continue our search with a new upper bound of 25 moves.

This process continues until we reach a point where any solution we haven't considered must be longer than the one we have‚Äîso our solution is optimal.

## The Domino Phase (Group Theory Implementation)

Kociemba's Algorithm doesn't actually solve F2L first. Once you've solved F2L, you can only do U moves without breaking up your progress, which is counterproductive.

Instead, Kociemba gets the cube into one of the states in **"G1"**, which means it has the following properties:

- **All corners are oriented** (like in 3OP - 3-style corners orientation)
- **All edges are oriented** (like in 3OP - 3-style edges orientation)  
- **All middle layer edges are already in the middle layer**

### Phase 2: Domino Solving

From the G1 state, you can solve the cube by using only `<U, D, F2, B2, R2, L2>`. That is, you can basically pretend it's a 3√ó3√ó2 domino puzzle.

**Key Advantages:**
- Once the cube is in G1/Domino state, you can search for an optimal Domino solution
- Every cube solution ends with some number of domino moves (might be 0, but often uses a few)
- This allows running the two-phase search with domino-restricted moves in the second half

## Advanced Implementation Details

### Computational Efficiency
- **Balanced Phases**: Solving a cube into G1 is about as hard as solving the rest, meaning both parts take roughly the same computation time
- **Symmetry Exploitation**: Since G1 is a mathematical group, there's significant symmetry in the search, allowing multiple searches simultaneously
- **Pruning Tables**: Efficient shortcuts using lookup tables‚Äîif you know it takes at least 10 moves to solve corners, you can eliminate certain search paths early

### Algorithm Optimizations
- **Short vs. Long Runs**: Quick runs give decent solutions; longer runs provide better solutions and eventually verify optimal ones
- **Multi-Phase Extensions**: Other puzzle solvers use similar approaches with more phases (e.g., 4√ó4√ó4 uses 4 phases)
- **IDA\* Implementation**: Most implementations use IDA* (iterative deepening combined with heuristics) instead of blind iterative deepening

## Practical Example

### WCA Scramble Analysis
Looking at Mats Valk's 5.55 WR scramble:
```
D2 U' R2 U F2 D2 U' R2 U' B' L2 R' B' D2 U B2 L' D' R2
```

Notice that the first half uses only `<U, D, F2, B2, R2, L2>`. This is because TNoodle (WCA scrambler) uses Shuang Chen's min2phase implementation:

1. Generate a random state
2. Solve the state using Kociemba
3. Invert the solution to get a scramble for the state

The last half of the solution becomes the first half of the scramble, which is why initial moves are in G1. You can see that G1 represents about half the scramble (9 out of 19 moves).

# üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide

## Python Implementation

The Kociemba Python package contains two equivalent implementations (C and Python) of Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm. The original Java implementation can be found at: http://kociemba.org/download.htm

### Key Implementation Notes
- These ports are straightforward and can likely be optimized further
- Extensively tested in real cube-solving machines (FAC System Solver and Meccano Rubik's Shrine)
- **Important**: The algorithm does not guarantee the shortest possible solution, but provides a "good enough" solution in very short time

### Standalone Tool Usage

When installing with pip, kociemba registers a command line tool:
```bash
$ kociemba <cubestring>
```

## Cube String Notation

The cube uses standard facelet position naming (letters stand for Up, Left, Front, Right, Back, and Down):

```
             |************|
             |*U1**U2**U3*|
             |************|
             |*U4**U5**U6*|
             |************|
             |*U7**U8**U9*|
             |************|
************|************|************|************
*L1**L2**L3*|*F1**F2**F3*|*R1**R2**R3*|*B1**B2**B3*
************|************|************|************
*L4**L5**L6*|*F4**F5**F6*|*R4**R5**R6*|*B4**B5**B6*
************|************|************|************
*L7**L8**L9*|*F7**F8**F9*|*R7**R8**R9*|*B7**B8**B9*
************|************|************|************
             |************|
             |*D1**D2**D3*|
             |************|
             |*D4**D5**D6*|
             |************|
             |*D7**D8**D9*|
             |************|
```

### Cube Definition String
A cube definition string "UBL..." means:
- Position U1 has U-color
- Position U2 has B-color  
- Position U3 has L-color
- And so on...

**Order**: U1-U9, R1-R9, F1-F9, D1-D9, L1-L9, B1-B9

**Solved Cube**: `UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB`

### Solution String Format
Solutions consist of space-separated moves:
- **Single letter** (e.g., `R`): Turn face clockwise 90¬∞
- **Letter + apostrophe** (e.g., `R'`): Turn face counter-clockwise 90¬∞
- **Letter + 2** (e.g., `R2`): Turn face 180¬∞

**Example**: `R U R' U R U2 R' U`

## C Implementation

C sources reside in the `ckociemba` folder. Running `make` compiles a standalone binary that:
- Accepts cube representation as command line argument
- Writes solution to standard output
- Can be integrated directly into other C projects

### Performance Characteristics
- **Preferred**: C implementation used when available (much faster)
- **Fallback**: Pure Python implementation (automatic fallback if C unavailable)
- **Typical Speed**: Solutions found in milliseconds to seconds

## Testing

To run the test suite:
```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Group Theory Applications
The Rubik's Cube represents a finite group with approximately 4.3 √ó 10^19 possible states. Kociemba's algorithm leverages this mathematical structure:

1. **Subgroup G1**: A carefully chosen subset of cube states with special properties
2. **Coset Decomposition**: Breaking the full cube group into manageable pieces
3. **Symmetry Reduction**: Using rotational and reflective symmetries to reduce search space

### Computational Complexity
- **State Space**: ~4.3 √ó 10^19 possible cube states
- **God's Number**: Maximum 20 moves needed for any cube (proven in 2010)
- **Algorithm Performance**: Typically finds solutions in 18-25 moves
- **Time Complexity**: Polynomial in practice due to effective pruning

### Comparison with Other Algorithms
- **Thistlethwaite**: 4 phases, more steps but simpler implementation
- **CFOP**: Human-friendly method, not optimal for computers
- **Roux**: Alternative human method, also suboptimal for algorithms
- **Optimal Solvers**: Exist but computationally expensive for regular use
